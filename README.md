### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working
through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you
want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

For this project, I made use of Framer Motion's staggering children functionality. By  
```html
      <motion.section
        variants={introVariants}
        initial='hidden'
        animate='visible'
      >
        <motion.article
          variants={introVariants}
        >
          <motion.h1
            variants={introVariants}
          >
            Award-winning custom designs and digital branding solutions
          </motion.h1>
            <motion.button
              variants={introVariants}
              whileHover={{
                backgroundColor: "#FFAD9B",
                color: "white",
                scale: 1.1,
              }}
            >
             ...
            </motion.button>
        </motion.article>
        <motion.div
          variants={introVariants}
          className='h-72 t:h-96 t:mb-20 d:mb-0'
        >
          ...
        </motion.div>
      </motion.section>
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in
future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable
with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
