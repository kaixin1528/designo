### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working
through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you
want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```


```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

I was able to blend together the background image with the background color, in this case dark grey with 75% opacity. This allows the background color to 
overlap nicely with the background image while allowing the main text to be legible.

```css
<motion.li
  className={`grid px-10 py-28 d:py-28 gap-3 t:gap-6 t:py-12 d:items-center bg-blend-multiply transition duration-300 ease-in-out transform hover:scale-105 bg-dark-grey hover:bg-peach bg-opacity-75 bg-center bg-cover bg-m-graphic-design t:bg-t-graphic-design d:bg-d-graphic-design rounded-xl`}

```

I made use of Framer Motion's staggering children functionality. By creating a variant for the intro component and applying 
the variant on subsequent descendants, I was able to make the components appear in sequence with a certain delay. 
effect 
```html
  <motion.section
    variants={introVariants}
    initial='hidden'
    animate='visible'
  >
    <motion.article
      variants={introVariants}
    >
      <motion.h1
        variants={introVariants}
      >
       ...
      </motion.h1>
        <motion.button
          variants={introVariants}
        >
         ...
        </motion.button>
    </motion.article>
    <motion.div
      variants={introVariants}
    >
      ...
    </motion.div>
  </motion.section>
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in
future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable
with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
